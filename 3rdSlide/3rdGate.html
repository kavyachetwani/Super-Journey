            The Gateway of India was built to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder during their visit to Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1911.
            The Gateway of India is built in the Indo-Saracenic architectural style, which is a fusion of Indian, Islamic, and European architectural elements. Its design incorporates domes, arches, and intricate latticework. It offers panoramic views of the Arabian Sea and is surrounded by bustling activity, including street vendors, photographers, and souvenir shops.
